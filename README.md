# php-odoo-jsonrpc-client

A simple Odoo JSON-RPC client you can understand - and with examples. Written in PHP.

Let's just put the truth out there - Odoo's API documentation is terrible... if you can even find any! But with this library I'll try
to make it a little less terrible to work with its API.
